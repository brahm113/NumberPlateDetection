# NumberPlateDetection
I have created a fine generation portal using the Spring MVC framework and integrated it with the image recognition algorithm. Here, this repository consists of the Maven Project that I have developed with SpringBoot that contains all the model, view, and controller files. 
I have developed this project for my final year in bachelor's of Computer Engineering in May 2019.
